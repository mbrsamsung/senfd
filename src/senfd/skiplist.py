SkipPatterns

This module provides functionality to load and manage a skip list for figures,
allowing selective exclusion of figures based on configurable patterns.

The skip list is defined in a TOML file and must follow this structure:

    [[skip]]
    regex = "^Decimal.and.Binary.Units$"
    matches = 1
    description = ""

    [[skip]]
    regex = "^Byte, Word, and Dword Relationships$"
    matches = 1
    description = ""

Each entry in the skip list consists of:
    - regex (str): A regular expression pattern used to match figure descriptions.
    - matches (int): The expected number of occurrences of figures matching the pattern.
    - description (str): An optional description explaining why the figure is skipped.

The `SkipPatterns` class reads the skip list from a TOML file, applies the patterns
to figure descriptions, and verifies that the number of matched figures aligns with
the expected count.

Usage:
    skip_patterns = SkipPatterns(list_path=Path("skiplist.toml"), figures=figure_list)
    if skip_patterns.skip_figure(figure):
        print(f"Skipping figure {figure.figure_nr}")

Raises:
    MultipleClassifierMatchException: If the actual number of matched figures
    defined in the SkipElement does not match the expected count.

This module enables flexible and regex-based skipping of figures in structured documents.
